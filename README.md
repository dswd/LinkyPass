LinkyPass
===============

LinkyPass is an awesome [Chrome Extension](http://chrome.google.com/extensions) that generates secure passwords,
unique to each website you visit, based on your own master password. You only have to remember one password,
but you'll get a different password for every website you visit. It builds on the great work of
[SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com), but makes it more secure & easier to use.

When you're not able to use LinkyPass, you can still use the tools available at
[SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com), they will generate the same passwords.

LinkyPass is super convinient to use,
